# Week 4: 23 october 2019


## This week tasks

- Unsderstand what is a generator in python
    * The `Dataset` class is in `gantools/data/core.py`
- Make the dataset
    * Retrain the model with the new data from the `solo` dataset
- Understand what is the sampling frequency, downsampling data

- Improve the global architecture
	* Understand the file `code/gantools/gantools/model.py` (class InpaintingGAN)
	* Make a new class similar to InpaintingGAN
		* with the context block
	* Steps:
		1. Understand the model code
		2. Draw current architecture
		3. Draw modification
		4. Check with Nathanaël if ok
		5. Code
