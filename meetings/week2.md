# Week 2: 10 october 2019

## This week tasks
1. Try to execute/understand the code
2. Try to run stuff on CSCS
3. Search for another dataset than piano (you can use maybe the free music archive)
4. Read the WaveGAN and TifGAN papers, maybe also Wavenet
5. Change a bit the architecture of the demo `GAN-audio-inpainting.ipynb` and try to overfit it.
	* To check overfitting, you need to create a test set. -> similar to the training
