## Amr: this week tasks

Part A: Solo Dataset
    - Check the `Dataset` class is in `gantools/data/core.py`
    - Understand what is the sampling frequency, downsampling data
    - Make the dataset
        * Retrain the model with the new data from the `solo` dataset

Part B: Improve the global architecture

  * Steps:
    1. Draw current architecture
    2. Draw modification
    3. Check with NathanaÃ«l if ok
    4. Understand the model code
    5. Code the new architecture in a new file...

  * Understand the file `code/gantools/gantools/model.py` (class InpaintingGAN)
  * Make a new class similar to InpaintingGAN
    * with the context block

## Pirmin: this week tasks

- Build a generator for the large dataset... (all the pipeline including some function to download the files)

- Time domain with maestro
  	* Prepare the dataset
  	  1. Cut in training/testing
  	  2. Prepare the data for the batches (2 secs, 1 sec, 2 secs) 
  	* Find a way to feed it into the network...
